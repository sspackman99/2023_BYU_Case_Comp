## Problem Statement
You and your team are employees of a brand new consulting firm, Anything Analytics. PEMDAS
Gaming, a major video game publisher, has just contacted your consulting firm and has offered
to provide your first major contract. Angela, a representative from PEMDAS Gaming, has
provided a small report of what they expect from you:

Anything Analytics Team,
The last few years have been interesting for the video gaming industry. Many consider video
games to be a luxury good, which means that sales react more to a struggling economy than do
other goods. However, sales during the Covid-19 pandemic have actually been great despite
many economic and financial challenges worldwide. Obviously, this could be directly related to
how much time people were spending at home. In any case, PEMDAS Gaming has decided that
we want to be prepared for future challenges. Our company wants to know how video game
sales react to economic conditions that may affect consumer spending habits. We want to
keep our personal sales data private, but there are a number of resources online for video
game sales data from other publishers as well as for major economic indicators. We want you
to provide us with a 10 minute presentation on the work you have done to gather, explore, and
model the data that can help us answer this question.
Sincerely,
Angela, PEMDAS Gaming

Bobby is the first member of your team to get started on this project, but unfortunately he will
not be able to make it to your presentation. He has found several useful data sources. First of
all, there is a website that collects video game sales, https://www.vgchartz.com. This site has a
variety of tables that contain current and total sales by region for a variety of video games. This
data has actually been webscraped by other data enthusiasts and some of it is contained on
Kaggle, the data set hosting site, and can be accessed using the link
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales. There is more data on
vgchartz.com than in the Kaggle data set, but it may be sufficient for the problem you have
been given. As with many Kaggle data sets, the video game sales data has some public analyses
available, such as the one at https://datascience.fm/video-game-sales-analysis/. These may be
helpful for understanding how to explore the data, but Bobby points out that the scope of the
problem you have been given is very different than what is contained in these analyses.

As far as economic indicators, Bobby found a data warehouse of world development indicators

through The World Bank, https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-
indicators. Bobby already downloaded some significant economic indicators for the U.S. and

Japan, two of the most important video game markets, using this data warehouse. This can be
found in the csv file https://richardson.byu.edu/data_contest/indicators.csv. Another variable
that Bobby collected is called the consumer confidence index (CCI). This was not found in the
World Bank data warehouse, but at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). This data warehouse can be accessed using the link
https://data.oecd.org/leadind/consumer-confidence-index-cci.htm. Again Bobby already
downloaded CCI values for U.S. and Japan, which can be found at
https://richardson.byu.edu/data_contest/CCI.csv.
Hopefully all the work Bobby did can help you get a head start. Your task is to explore and
understand the data, combine it in useful ways, and evaluate the model in order to answer
PEMDAS Gamingâ€™s main question about how video game sales are related to general economic
conditions. It is important for the future of Anything Analytics that you are able to do well on
this project.
